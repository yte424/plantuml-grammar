# plantuml-grammar
a ANTLR grammar for PlantUML language

## Description

I recently discover [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) as beautiful and plain UML modelling tool. Therefore, my idea is to use it in a context of model driven development(MDSD), so I try to build a grammar for with ANTLR. I know that PlantUML is not defined with a grammar but with regular expressions. But I think this is a good learning project to start with ANTLR,

This is work in progress.
